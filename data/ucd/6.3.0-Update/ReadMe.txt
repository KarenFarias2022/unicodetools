This directory contains data updated 
from Version 6.2.0 of the Unicode Standard.

NOTE: This data is currently in development for
the beta review for Version 6.3.0 of the Unicode
Standard.

Also note that derived and extracted data files are produced
by running a number of scripts and then populating
the data directory with the results. There is no guarantee
that at any given time all of the derived and extracted
data files are completely in synch with the primary
data files, because the scripts for derived and extracted
data files are only run occasionally, as warranted, whereas
spot fixes for data files such as UnicodeData.txt may
be posted more frequently. Use care when using the extracted
or derived data files during the beta review period, and
do not bother to report minor discrepancies in synchronization,
unless there appears to be a systematic issue with how
a particular derivation or extraction has been generated.

Do *NOT* attempt to make use of this data in any
Unicode-based product.

This material is posted at this time to assist
UTC members in tracking some particular sets of
changes to character properties made by UTC consensus
decisions, and to track corrections for some minor
errors in documentation or data files. Keep in mind that
these particular data files may be changed at any
time, be renamed, or even be removed, pending further
UTC decisions.

Watch the beta notice page:

http://www.unicode.org/versions/beta.html

and notification email for indication when any
new beta review period for a future version of
the Unicode Standard will be starting.
