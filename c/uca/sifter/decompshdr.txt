# Each line contains three fields, separated by a semicolon.
#
# Field 0: code point
#
# Field 1: decomposition tag
#
# Field 2: decomposition
#
# Those three fields are then followed by a comment, delimited with "#",
# showing the name of the character and the names associated with the
# decomposition sequence, to make it easier to understand the listing
# without having to look up code points.
#
# The decompositions used in the generation of DUCET are loosely based
# on the normative decomposition mappings defined in UnicodeData.txt
# in the Unicode Character Database. An examination of this data listing
# clearly shows the close relationship to the decomposition mappings.
# However, those decomposition mappings are adjusted as part of the input
# to the generation of DUCET, in order to produce default weights more
# appropriate for collation. Those adjusted
# decompositions fall into several classes:
#
# 1. In some cases a decomposition mapping from UnicodeData.txt is
#    suppressed.
#
# 2. In some cases a decomposition mapping from UnicodeData.txt is
#    modified.
#
# 3. In some cases a new decomposition is added for a character which
#    has no decomposition mapping in UnicodeData.txt. 
#
#    In this third case, sometimes no decomposition tag is added
#    to the new decomposition. In those instances, weighting is done as
#    if the character had a canonical decomposition in UnicodeData.txt.
#    In other instances a new decomposition tag "<sort>" is introduced.
#    That tag results in weighting with a distinct tertiary weight,
#    as if the character had a <compat> decomposition tag in
#    UnicodeData.txt.
#
# Note that these adjusted decompositions are only defined for the
# purpose of generating the DUCET table. They are not to be interpreted
# as having any implications for the Unicode Normalization
# Algorithm.
#
# The decomposition tags in this file are derived from the normative
# Decomposition_Type values, but differ from them, in part because
# of the introduction of the "<sort>" tag.
#
# It is also important to note that the decompositions documented in
# this file occasionally make use of private use characters, with private
# semantics internal to the utility used to generate DUCET. The use
# of these private use code points is *NOT* to be interpreted as
# a reservation of those private use code points by the Unicode Consortium
# or as a designation of any specific meaning or properties for those
# particular private use code points for the purposes of interchange.
# The names used in the decomps.txt listing for those private use
# code points are arbitrarily assigned and internal to the utility.
# They are in no way endorsed by the Unicode Consortium.
