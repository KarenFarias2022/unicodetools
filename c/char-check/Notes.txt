This code uses ICU to make a UnicodeSet that can be tested for whether a character is encoded, and is one of the valid types for the AAC project.


----------------

Mark's notes of things to check for the next update.

The code looks reasonable to me, but it's been a while since I've looked at C code. Presuming that you are handling the swastikas, etc, outside of this.

Minor: 

I think

    if(U_FAILURE(status)) {
      printf("%04X;VALID\n", c);
      return 0;

should be

    if(U_FAILURE(status)) {
      printf("%04X;INVALID\n", c);
      return 2;

If there is no character name in ICU for a valid character, something is seriously wrong, and we don't want to allow sponsorship.
