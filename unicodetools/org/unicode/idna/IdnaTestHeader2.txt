#
# FORMAT:
#
# This file is in UTF8, with certain characters escaped using the \uXXXX or \x{XXXX}
# convention where they could otherwise have a confusing display.
# These characters include:
# 
# - General Categories C, Z, and M
# - Default ignorable characters
# - Bidi categories R, AL, AN
# 
# Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons.
# Leading and trailing spaces and tabs in each column are ignored.
# Comments are indicated with hash marks.
#
# Column 1: source -          The source string to be tested
# Column 2: toUnicode -       The result of applying toUnicode to the source, with Transitional_Processing=false.
#                             A blank value means the same as the source value.
# Column 3: toUnicodeStatus - A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means [].
# Column 4: toAsciiN -        The result of applying toASCII to the source, with Transitional_Processing=false.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toUnicode value.
# Column 5: toAsciiNStatus -  A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toUnicodeStatus value.
# Column 6: toAsciiT -        The result of applying toASCII to the source, with Transitional_Processing=true.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toAsciiN value.
# Column 7: toAsciiTStatus -  A set of status codes, each corresponding to a particular test.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toAsciiNStatus value.
#
# The line comments currently show visible characters that have been escaped 
# (after removing default-ignorables and controls, except for whitespace)
#
# CONFORMANCE:
#
# To test for conformance to UTS46, an implementation will perform the toUnicode, toAsciiN, and toAsciiT
# operations on the source string, then verify the resulting strings and relevant status values.
#
# A status in toUnicode, toAsciiN or toAsciiT is indicated by a value in square brackets, such as "[B5 B6]".
# In such a case, the contents is a list of status codes based on the step numbers in UTS46 and IDNA2008,
# with the following formats:
#
#   Pn for Section 4 Processing step n
#   Vn for 4.1 Validity Criteria step n
#   U1 for UseSTD3ASCIIRules
#   An for 4.2 ToASCII step n
#   Bn for Bidi (in IDNA2008)
#   Cn for ContextJ (in IDNA2008)
#
# Thus C1 = Appendix A.1. ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER, and C2 = Appendix A.2. ZERO WIDTH JOINER. 
# (The CONTEXTO tests are optional for client software, and not tested here.)
#
# Implementations that allow values of particular input flags to be false would ignore
# the corresponding status codes listed in the table below when testing for errors.
#
# VerifyDnsLength:   P4
# CheckHyphens:      V2, V3
# CheckBidi:         V8
# CheckJoiners:      V7
# UseSTD3ASCIIRules: U1
# Idna2008:          NV8
#
# Implementations may be more strict than the default settings for UTS46.
# In particular, an implementation conformant to IDNA2008 would disallow the input for lines marked with NV8.
#
# Implementations need only record that there is an error: they need not reproduce the precise status codes
# (after removing the ignored status values).
