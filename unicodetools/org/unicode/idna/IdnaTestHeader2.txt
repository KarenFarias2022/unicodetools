# Contains test cases for verifying UTS46 conformance. For more information,

#
# FORMAT:
#
# This file is in UTF8, with certain characters escaped using the \uXXXX or \x{XXXX}
# convention where they could otherwise have a confusing display.
# These characters include:
# 
# - General Categories C, Z, and M
# - Default ignorable characters
# - Bidi categories R, AL, AN
# 
# Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons.
# Leading and trailing spaces and tabs in each column are ignored.
# Comments are indicated with hash marks.
#
#  Column 1: type -           T for transitional, N for nontransitional, B for both
#  Column 2: source -         The source string to be tested
#  Column 3: toUnicode -      The result of applying toUnicode to the source, using nontransitional. 
#                             A blank value means the same as the source value; a value in [...] is a set of status codes.
#  Column 4: toASCII -        The result of applying toASCII to the source, using the specified type: T, N, or B.
#                             A blank value means the same as the toUnicode value; a value in [...] is a set of status codes.
#  Column 5: idna2008Status - NV8 is only present if the status is valid but the character is excluded by IDNA2008
#                             from all domain names for all versions of Unicode.
#                             XV8 is present when the character is excluded by IDNA2008 for the current version of Unicode. 
#                             These are informative values only.
#
# If the value of toUnicode is the same as source, the column will be blank.
# The line comments currently show visible characters that have been escaped 
# (after removing default-ignorables and controls, except for whitespace)
#
# An error in toUnicode or toASCII is indicated by a value in square brackets, such as "[B5 B6]".
# In such a case, the contents is a list of error codes based on the step numbers in UTS46 and IDNA2008,
# with the following formats:
#
#   Pn for Section 4 Processing step n
#   Vn for 4.1 Validity Criteria step n
#   U1 for UseSTD3ASCIIRules
#   An for 4.2 ToASCII step n
#   Bn for Bidi (in IDNA2008)
#   Cn for ContextJ (in IDNA2008)
#
# However, these particular error codes are only informative;
# the important feature is whether or not there is an error.
#
# CONFORMANCE:
#
# To test for conformance to UTS46, an implementation must first perform the toUnicode operation
# on the source string, then the toASCII operation (with the indicated type) on the source string.
#
# Implementations that allow values of the input flags to be false would remove the corresponding
# status codes listed in the table below.
#
# VerifyDnsLength:    P4
# CheckHyphens:       V2, V3
# CheckBidi:          V8
# CheckJoiners:       V7
# UseSTD3ASCIIRules:  U1
# DisallowedIdna2008: NV8
#
# Implementations may be more strict than UTS46; thus they may have errors where the file indicates results.
# In particular, an implementation conformant to IDNA2008 would disallow the input for lines marked with NV8.
#
# Implementations need only record that there is an error: they need not reproduce the precise status codes.
